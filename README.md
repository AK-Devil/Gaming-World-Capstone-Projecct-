# Gaming Spark

A capstone project is the closing project that students will perform solo. It is designed to assess the student's technical and professional skills from the block that it is closing. For this project, a concept, responsive, mobile-first web page is presented.
The project includes 2 pages, including "Home" and "Search".conography have been severely altered, the main layout, fonts, and colors have been respected. I thank the Creative Commons website for allowing me to use their template for this project.
